# Minesweeper
A clone of the classic game Minesweeper to reintroduce myself to coding.

# Features

- Customisable Difficulty (with preset options).
- Regular Minesweeper Gameplay:
  - Left click to reveal a cell (must be unflagged).
  - Right-click an unrevealed cell to flag it.
  - Right-click a flagged cell to mark it as a possible mine (?).
  - Right-click a possible mine to unflag it completely.
- Impossible to hit a mine in first turn.
- Chording of cells with correct number of flags to reveal all adjacent cells.
  - This happens automatically for cells with no adjacent mines.
